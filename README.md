## Introduction
This repository provides information and resources related to linear regression on multiple features, a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between multiple feature variables and one independent variable.

## General Equation
The general equation for multiple linear regression is as follows:

Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + \ldots + \beta_pX_p + \epsilon

Where:
- \(Y\) is the dependent variable (the target you want to predict).
- \(\beta_0\) is the intercept, representing the value of \(Y\) when all \(X\) values are zero.
- \(\beta_1, \beta_2, \ldots, \beta_p\) are the coefficients of the independent variables \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p\), respectively. These coefficients represent the change in \(Y\) for a one-unit change in the corresponding \(X\) while holding all other variables constant.
- \(X_1, X_2, \ldots, X_p\) are the independent variables or features.
- \(\epsilon\) represents the error term, which accounts for the variability in \(Y\) that cannot be explained by the linear relationship with the independent variables. It is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of zero.

The goal of multiple linear regression is to estimate the coefficients (\(\beta_0, \beta_1, \ldots, \beta_p\)) that minimize the sum of squared differences between the observed values of \(Y\) and the predicted values (\(\hat{Y}\)) based on the linear model.

## Dataset
This repository uses the following dataset for demonstrating multiple linear regression:

- Dataset: [Pakistan Used Car Prices 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/talhabarkaatahmad/pakistan-used-car-prices-2023/data)

Feel free to explore and use this dataset for practicing multiple linear regression analysis.

## Packages Used
In this project, the following Python packages are used for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning:

- `pandas` (imported as `pd`) for data handling.
- `numpy` (imported as `np`) for numerical operations.
- `seaborn` (imported as `sns`) for data visualization.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` (imported as `plt`) for creating plots and charts.
- `sklearn.model_selection` for train-test splitting.
- `sklearn.linear_model` for implementing the Linear Regression model.
- `sklearn.preprocessing` for data preprocessing tasks such as encoding categorical variables.
- `sklearn.compose` for composing transformers for feature transformations.

You can use these packages to work with the dataset and perform multiple linear regression analysis. Refer to the provided code examples in this repository for guidance on how to use these packages effectively.

To install the required Python packages mentioned in your README, you can use a package manager called `pip`, which is commonly used for installing Python libraries. Here's how you can install each of the packages:

1. **pandas**:
   To install pandas, use the following command:
   ```
   pip install pandas
   ```

2. **numpy**:
   To install numpy, use the following command:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```

3. **seaborn**:
   To install seaborn, use the following command:
   ```
   pip install seaborn
   ```

4. **matplotlib**:
   To install matplotlib, use the following command:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib
   ```

5. **scikit-learn (sklearn)**:
   To install scikit-learn, use the following command:
   ```
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

These commands will download and install the packages from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and make them available for use in your Python environment.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system before running these commands. Additionally, it's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your project to isolate its dependencies. You can do this using tools like `virtualenv` or `conda` to manage your Python environments.

Here's a general guide on how to set up a virtual environment and install packages within it:

1. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```
   # Using virtualenv (install if not already installed)
   pip install virtualenv

   # Create a virtual environment named "myenv"
   virtualenv myenv

   # Activate the virtual environment
   # On Windows:
   myenv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS and Linux:
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install packages within the virtual environment**:
   After activating your virtual environment, you can use `pip` to install the required packages as mentioned above.

By following these steps, you'll have a clean environment for your project with the necessary packages installed.
